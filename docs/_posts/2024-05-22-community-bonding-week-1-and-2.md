I'm excited to be working with the JdeRobot community on the Robotics-Academy project. Google Summer of Code begins with a community bonding period, during which we familiarize ourselves with the community and explore the project to gain a better understanding.

#### Objectives

- [x] Set up blog website using Jekyll and Github Pages
- [x] Write a first blog for the community bonding period

This week, we had our first official meeting where we introduced ourselves and the mentors reviewed the program's logistics. In addition to my project mentors, I also got to know the other contributors selected for GSoC 2024 JdeRobot, as well as other members of the organization.

Before the official start of GSoC, I had already been using Robotics-Academy. I contributed by opening GitHub issues and submitting pull requests ([#2462](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2462), [#2460](https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2460)). These contributions were for the RADI version 3.x.x, which is based on ROS Noetic.  

Also, the GSoC 2024 Contributor Summit was organized by the GSoC team. It included talks on AI and open source, security, OSS licensing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), followed by Q&A sessions with the speakers. It was an informative and inspiring event for all the participants.
