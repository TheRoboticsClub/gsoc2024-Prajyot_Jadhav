The initial project goal was migrating Robotics-Academy to Gazebo Fortress. However, considering that the end-of-life (EOL) for Gazebo Fortress is in September 2026, it was decided in the weekly meeting to migrate Robotics-Academy to Gazebo Harmonic, a LTS (Long-Term Support) version with an EOL in September 2028. 

#### Objectives

- [x] Understanding the codebase of RoboticsInfrastructure and RoboticsApplicationManager repositories
- [x] Getting acquainted with running and building Docker Images through Dockerfiles

In the weekly meeting, we discussed the project's Contributing Guidelines, to ensure I follow the best practices while contributing to the codebase. Additionally, the mentors introduced me to the Scrum methodology, which will be used to manage my contributions and track progress efficiently.

The project timeline was also reviewed. The mentors also discussed a detailed work plan outlining the steps and deliverables for each phase.
