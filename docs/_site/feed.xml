<p>Last week, I created a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gz Sim</code> world type for the exercise template by migrating the Django model. However, while reviewing the RoboticsApplicationManager codebase, I discovered that the GazeboView launcher is launched during the visualization step. Consequently, I had to revert the previous weekâ€™s changes and create two new visualization options: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gz Sim GRA</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gz Sim RAE</code>. Now, when these fields are selected for visualization, the new Gz Sim launcher is launched for the Gazebo Sim GUI.</p>

<p>Next, I updated the drones_ros2 launcher, which is used for the drones and ROS2 world type. Instead of launching the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aerostack2_default_gazebo_classic</code> launch file, it now launches the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aerostack2_default_gazebo_sim</code> launch file from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jderobot_drones</code> package.</p>

<p>I updated the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aerostack2_default_gazebo_sim</code> launch file to launch the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as2_platform_gazebo</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as2_gazebo_assets</code> packages. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">as2_gazebo_assets</code> package is now launched in headless mode. This means that only the Gazebo server is started, without the GUI. The Gazebo GUI can be launched separately during the visualization step using the new Gz Sim launcher.</p>

<p>The issue with the gazebo11-gz-cli PPA not supporting ROS packages on Jammy (<a href="https://github.com/gazebo-tooling/release-tools/issues/1152">#1152</a>) has been resolved. This allowed me to successfully install Gazebo11 along with Gz Harmonic for the RADI. Previously, I encountered an issue during the installation of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ros-humble-gazebo-ros</code> package, but that has now been fixed. Initially, I had temporarily commented out the sourcing and compiling of the workspaces. However, with the dependency installation issues resolved, I was able to build the workspaces successfully.</p>

<p>I updated the hooks for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CustomRobots</code> package and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> script for Gz Harmonic. During this migration, I discovered that Gz Sim does not have a separate model path, as it treats both models and worlds as resources. In Gazebo Classic, the environment variables <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH</code> were used for models and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH</code> for worlds and some rendering resources. However, in Gz Sim, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GZ_SIM_RESOURCE_PATH</code> is used for worlds, models, and other resources.</p>

<p>The world file for the rescue people exercise was migrated to Gz Harmonic using the previously migrated drone_assets.</p>

<p>Similarly, the world for the follow road exercise was also migrated to Gazebo Harmonic. During this process, I found that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;road&gt;</code> tag used in the Gazebo Classic world file is not supported in Gz Sim <a href="https://github.com/gazebosim/gz-sim/issues/2320">(#2320)</a>. To address this, I created two new models for the road track: one for curves and another for straight sections.</p>

<p>Last week, I faced a black screen when launching the Gazebo GUI from another terminal inside the container while executing the first two steps of the dummy client. We discovered that the issue was due to models being added to the Gazebo world from <a href="https://app.gazebosim.org/fuel">Gazebo Fuel</a> via SDF snippets (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://fuel.gazebosim.org/1.0/OpenRobotics/models/Coke</code>). By removing the SDF snippets for the two models (sun and ground plane), the issue was resolved. I created an empty world file in RoboticsInfrastructure without the sun and ground plane models, which is used during dummy client testing.</p>

<p>Last week, I encountered difficulties while testing the new RAM launcher with the dummy client.  During our meeting, Pedro guided me on debugging and development with the dummy client. In the dummy client, for the second step of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">launch_world</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple_circuit_followingcam.launch.py</code> file is launched. My focus was on modifying this file to make it compatible with Gazebo Harmonic. I updated the file, replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo_ros</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ros_gz</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gzserver.launch.py</code> file with the corresponding one from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ros_gz</code> package. Using the dummy client, I successfully executed the first two steps: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">launch_world</code>. The third step, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepare_visualization</code>, which launches the Gazebo GUI, was commented out. I managed to launch the Gazebo GUI from another terminal inside the container, but encountered a black screen. Running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gz sim -g</code> command with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-v4</code> argument showed that the GUI was requesting a list of world names and the server was downloading resources. I am currently working on resolving this issue.</p>

    New RADI with Gazebo Harmonic (with xhost +)
</div> -->

<p>Previously, I had found that the default configuration file for the Gazebo SIM GUI is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.gz/gui/default.config</code>. However, for Gazebo Harmonic, the correct path is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.gz/sim/&lt;#&gt;/gui.config</code> (where &lt;#&gt; represents Gazebo Simâ€™s major version). I attempted to launch an empty_world with a modified config file specifying only the window dimensions. However, I observed that a specific set of plugins is necessary to launch an empty_world, and if these are missing, the default config file is used. My next task would be to create a new config file containing only the required plugins, removing unnecessary elements from the Gazebo GUI.</p>

<p>While migrating models in drone_assets to Gazebo Harmonic, I discovered that Gazebo SIM does not support Ogre material files like Classic does, due to its compatibility with multiple rendering engines. In Gazebo Sim, textures can be passed as the albedo map. Therefore, in the sdf files of the models the following code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;material&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    &lt;uri&gt;model://number1/materials/scripts&lt;/uri&gt;
    &lt;uri&gt;model://number1/materials/textures&lt;/uri&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Number/One&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/material&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>was replaced with:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;material&gt;
  &lt;pbr&gt;
    &lt;metal&gt;
      &lt;albedo_map&gt;model://number1/materials/textures/texture.png&lt;/albedo_map&gt;
    &lt;/metal&gt;
  &lt;/pbr&gt;
&lt;/material&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I added new models for ocean and polaris_ranger_ev. The models yet to be migrated are: gas_station, house_3, UAVs (iris and typhoon h480). Also the system plugin <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libwall2plugin.so</code> used in the cylinder and wall models is to be migrated.</p>

<h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create a new Gazebo Harmonic launcher for Robotics Application Manager</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="work-done">Work Done</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Understood the code of the existing Gazebo View launcher and the related files for Docker Threading and VNC server</li>
  <li>By referring to the old Gazebo View launcher, created a new launcher for Gazebo Harmonic by:
    <ul>
      <li>Updating the commands used for configuring the browser screen dimensions for Gazebo GUI</li>
      <li>Replacing the commands for starting gzclient with those for starting Gazebo Simâ€™s GUI</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Created a new RADI with installation of Gazebo 11 along with Gazebo Harmonic</li>
</ul>

<p>In the old Gazebo View launcher, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gui.ini</code> file was modified to set the geometry of the Gazebo client window. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gui.ini</code> file is a configuration file used by Gazebo Classic to store settings related to the graphical user interface. This file contains parameters that control the appearance of the Gazebo GUI, such as window size and position.</p>

<p>The new Gazebo Sim does not use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gui.ini</code> file for GUI configurations. Instead, GUI configurations are handled through XML configuration files that define what the window should look like and which plugins should be loaded. By default, Gazebo GUI will load the config file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.gz/gui/default.config</code>, if it exists.</p>

<p>For Gazebo Classic, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo</code> command runs two different executables, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gzserver</code> and second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gzclient</code>. The gzclient executable runs a QT based user interface that visualizes the simulation and provides control over various simulation properties.
For Gazebo sim the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gz sim</code> command launches both the Sim server and Sim GUI. The GUI can be run independently using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-g</code> (gui only) flag.</p>

<p>Also, Pedro had raised a issue for the <a href="https://github.com/gazebosim/docs/issues/449">Installing Gazebo11 side by side with new Gazebo not working</a>, which was resolved. I created a new RADI with both Gazebo 11 and Gazebo Harmonic installed. However, I still encountered installation failures for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo-ros2-control</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo-ros</code> during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rosdep install</code>. The sourcing and compiling of the workspace has been temporarily commented out until we can address this issues.</p>

</ul>

<h4 id="work-done">Work Done</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Modified Dockerfiles to:
    <ul>
      <li>Replace Gazebo 11 with Gazebo Harmonic</li>
      <li>Remove the installation of PX4 and MICRO-XRCE-DDS-AGENT</li>
      <li>Remove the cloning of as2_platform_pixhawk and px4_msgs repositories</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Determined that the CustomRobots package has gazebo-ros and gazebo-ros2-control as dependencies</li>
  <li>Checked out the installation of Gazebo 11 along with Gazebo Harmonic</li>
</ul>

<p>I encountered the following error while building an image from the modified Dockerfiles. Replacing Gazebo11 with Gazebo Harmonic caused installation failures for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo-ros2-control</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo-ros</code> during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rosdep install</code>. These are the dependencies for the CustomRobots package, as specified in its <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsInfrastructure/blob/humble-devel/CustomRobots/package.xml">package.xml</a> file. To address this, the sourcing and compiling of the workspace have been temporarily commented out.</p>

<p>Additionally, I tested whether Gazebo11 can be installed alongside Gazebo Harmonic by following the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/gazebosim/docs/blob/master/install_gz11_side_by_side.md">Installing Gazebo11 side by side with new Gazebo</a>. However, I found that these instructions resulted in only Gazebo Harmonic being installed.</p>

However, considering that the end-of-life (EOL) for Gazebo Fortress is in September 2026, it was decided in the weekly meeting to migrate Robotics-Academy to Gazebo Harmonic, a LTS (Long-Term Support) version with an EOL in September 2028.</p>

<h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Understanding the codebase of RoboticsInfrastructure and RoboticsApplicationManager repositories</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Getting acquainted with running and building Docker Images through Dockerfiles</li>
</ul>

<p>In the weekly meeting, we discussed the projectâ€™s Contributing Guidelines, to ensure I follow the best practices while contributing to the codebase. Additionally, the mentors introduced me to the Scrum methodology, which will be used to manage my contributions and track progress efficiently.</p>

<p>The project timeline was also reviewed. The mentors also discussed a detailed work plan outlining the steps and deliverables for each phase.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 3 of the community bonding period]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Community Bonding: May 6 ~ May 19</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/gsoc2024-Prajyot_Jadhav/blog/2024/community-bonding-week-1-and-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Community Bonding: May 6 ~ May 19" /><published>2024-05-22T22:10:16+05:30</published><updated>2024-05-22T22:10:16+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/gsoc2024-Prajyot_Jadhav/blog/2024/community-bonding-week-1-and-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/gsoc2024-Prajyot_Jadhav/blog/2024/community-bonding-week-1-and-2/"><![CDATA[<p>Iâ€™m excited to be working with the JdeRobot community on the Robotics-Academy project. Google Summer of Code begins with a community bonding period, during which we familiarize ourselves with the community and explore the project to gain a better understanding.</p>

<h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Set up blog website using Jekyll and Github Pages</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Write a first blog for the community bonding period</li>
</ul>

<p>This week, we had our first official meeting where we introduced ourselves and the mentors reviewed the programâ€™s logistics. In addition to my project mentors, I also got to know the other contributors selected for GSoC 2024 JdeRobot, as well as other members of the organization.</p>

<p>Before the official start of GSoC, I had already been using Robotics-Academy. I contributed by opening GitHub issues and submitting pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2462">#2462</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2460">#2460</a>). These contributions were for the RADI version 3.x.x, which is based on ROS Noetic.</p>

<p>Also, the GSoC 2024 Contributor Summit was organized by the GSoC team. It included talks on AI and open source, security, OSS licensing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), followed by Q&amp;A sessions with the speakers. It was an informative and inspiring event for all the participants.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 1 and 2 of the community bonding period]]></summary></entry></feed>
