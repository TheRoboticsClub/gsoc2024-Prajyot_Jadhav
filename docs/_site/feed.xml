  <li>Migrated drone_assets to Gazebo Harmonic</li>
</ul>

<p>Last week, I encountered difficulties while testing the new RAM launcher with the dummy client.  During our meeting, Pedro guided me on debugging and development with the dummy client. In the dummy client, for the second step of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">launch_world</code>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple_circuit_followingcam.launch.py</code> file is launched. My focus was on modifying this file to make it compatible with Gazebo Harmonic. I updated the file, replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo_ros</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ros_gz</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gzserver.launch.py</code> file with the corresponding one from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ros_gz</code> package. Using the dummy client, I successfully executed the first two steps: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connect</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">launch_world</code>. The third step, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepare_visualization</code>, which launches the Gazebo GUI, was commented out. I managed to launch the Gazebo GUI from another terminal inside the container, but encountered a black screen. Running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gz sim -g</code> command with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-v4</code> argument showed that the GUI was requesting a list of world names and the server was downloading resources. I am currently working on resolving this issue.</p>

</div> -->

<p>Previously, I had found that the default configuration file for the Gazebo SIM GUI is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.gz/gui/default.config</code>. However, for Gazebo Harmonic, the correct path is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.gz/sim/&lt;#&gt;/gui.config</code> (where &lt;#&gt; represents Gazebo Sim’s major version). I attempted to launch an empty_world with a modified config file specifying only the window dimensions. However, I observed that a specific set of plugins is necessary to launch an empty_world, and if these are missing, the default config file is used. My next task would be to create a new config file containing only the required plugins, removing unnecessary elements from the Gazebo GUI.</p>

<p>While migrating models in drone_assets to Gazebo Harmonic, I discovered that Gazebo SIM does not support Ogre material files like Classic does, due to its compatibility with multiple rendering engines. In Gazebo Sim, textures can be passed as the albedo map. Therefore, in the sdf files of the models the following code:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;material&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    &lt;uri&gt;model://number1/materials/scripts&lt;/uri&gt;
    &lt;uri&gt;model://number1/materials/textures&lt;/uri&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;Number/One&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/material&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>was replaced with:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;material&gt;
  &lt;pbr&gt;
    &lt;metal&gt;
      &lt;albedo_map&gt;model://number1/materials/textures/texture.png&lt;/albedo_map&gt;
    &lt;/metal&gt;
  &lt;/pbr&gt;
&lt;/material&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I added new models for ocean and polaris_ranger_ev. The models yet to be migrated are: gas_station, house_3, UAVs (iris and typhoon h480). Also the system plugin <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">libwall2plugin.so</code> used in the cylinder and wall models is to be migrated.</p>

<h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />Create a new Gazebo Harmonic launcher for Robotics Application Manager</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="work-done">Work Done</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Understood the code of the existing Gazebo View launcher and the related files for Docker Threading and VNC server</li>
  <li>By referring to the old Gazebo View launcher, created a new launcher for Gazebo Harmonic by:
    <ul>
      <li>Updating the commands used for configuring the browser screen dimensions for Gazebo GUI</li>
      <li>Replacing the commands for starting gzclient with those for starting Gazebo Sim’s GUI</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Created a new RADI with installation of Gazebo 11 along with Gazebo Harmonic</li>
</ul>

<p>In the old Gazebo View launcher, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gui.ini</code> file was modified to set the geometry of the Gazebo client window. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gui.ini</code> file is a configuration file used by Gazebo Classic to store settings related to the graphical user interface. This file contains parameters that control the appearance of the Gazebo GUI, such as window size and position.</p>

<p>The new Gazebo Sim does not use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gui.ini</code> file for GUI configurations. Instead, GUI configurations are handled through XML configuration files that define what the window should look like and which plugins should be loaded. By default, Gazebo GUI will load the config file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HOME/.gz/gui/default.config</code>, if it exists.</p>

<p>For Gazebo Classic, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo</code> command runs two different executables, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gzserver</code> and second <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gzclient</code>. The gzclient executable runs a QT based user interface that visualizes the simulation and provides control over various simulation properties.
For Gazebo sim the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gz sim</code> command launches both the Sim server and Sim GUI. The GUI can be run independently using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-g</code> (gui only) flag.</p>

<p>Also, Pedro had raised a issue for the <a href="https://github.com/gazebosim/docs/issues/449">Installing Gazebo11 side by side with new Gazebo not working</a>, which was resolved. I created a new RADI with both Gazebo 11 and Gazebo Harmonic installed. However, I still encountered installation failures for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo-ros2-control</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gazebo-ros</code> during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rosdep install</code>. The sourcing and compiling of the workspace has been temporarily commented out until we can address this issues.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Determined that the CustomRobots package has gazebo-ros and gazebo-ros2-control as dependencies</li>
  <li>Checked out the installation of Gazebo 11 along with Gazebo Harmonic</li>
</ul>

<p>I encountered the following error while building an image from the modified Dockerfiles.

These are the dependencies for the CustomRobots package, as specified in its <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsInfrastructure/blob/humble-devel/CustomRobots/package.xml">package.xml</a> file. To address this, the sourcing and compiling of the workspace have been temporarily commented out.</p>

Google Summer of Code begins with a community bonding period, during which we familiarize ourselves with the community and explore the project to gain a better understanding.</p>

<h4 id="objectives">Objectives</h4>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Set up blog website using Jekyll and Github Pages</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />Write a first blog for the community bonding period</li>
</ul>

<p>This week, we had our first official meeting where we introduced ourselves and the mentors reviewed the program’s logistics. In addition to my project mentors, I also got to know the other contributors selected for GSoC 2024 JdeRobot, as well as other members of the organization.</p>

<p>Before the official start of GSoC, I had already been using Robotics-Academy. I contributed by opening GitHub issues and submitting pull requests (<a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2462">#2462</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy/pull/2460">#2460</a>). These contributions were for the RADI version 3.x.x, which is based on ROS Noetic.</p>

<p>Also, the GSoC 2024 Contributor Summit was organized by the GSoC team. It included talks on AI and open source, security, OSS licensing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), followed by Q&amp;A sessions with the speakers. It was an informative and inspiring event for all the participants.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 1 and 2 of the community bonding period]]></summary></entry></feed>
